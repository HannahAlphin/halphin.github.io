<p>I listed some of my favorite <a href="index.html">Ed Tech Tools</a> and want to provide examples of how I have used them in projects throughout college.</p>


<h1>Projects</h1>

<ul>
<li><b>Video Research Project:</b>
As part of an Independent Study, researched the true crime community on YouTube and used Camtasia to compose a fourteen-minute video summarizing findings</li>
<li><b>
Podcast:</b>
Used Audacity to compose a podcast that shares my personal experience and the history of a specific place on UNC-Chapel Hillâ€™s campus</li>
<li><b>Twine Project:
</b>
Worked in a group to collect tweets in Google Spreadsheet related to the Silent Sam event at UNC-Chapel Hill.
Then used Twine to create an individual, interactive story that emphasizes the history and significance of the event

</li>
<li><b>Explainer Video
:</b>
Used Powtoon to compose an animated explainer video on the topic of computing security</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you like to write and are a fan of non-linear storytelling or games, <a href="https://twinery.org/" target="_blank">Twine</a> is an exciting and free tool to check out!</p>

<p>As I learn about more Ed Tech Tools, I appreciate how they can be used to develop educational material that is interactive and engaging.</p>
