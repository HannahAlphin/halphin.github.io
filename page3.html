<h2>Open Sources</h2>
<p>I have discovered many open source tools and technologies through school and my job. These are especially useful becuase they are free and easy to access and share your work.</p>

  <p>Here is a list of my favorites:<p/>
<ul>
<li>Moodle</li>
<li>Articulate E-Leanring Heroes Community</li>
<li>Voyant Tools</li>
<li>Khan Academy</li>
<li>Google Arts and Culture "Museum Views"</li>
</ul>
