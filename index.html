<h2>My Favorite Ed Tech Tools</h2>
<ol>
<li>Articulate Storyline 360
I am very familar with Storyline 360 because I use it at my job. It is a great software for creating interactive eLearning content.</li>
<li>Camtasia
I used Camtasia a lot during my undergrad to edit videos for projects. I like how easy it is to learn and navigate.</li>
<li>Powtoon
I have used Powtoon in the past to create animated explainer videos. I enjoy how it allows you to add characters and graphics to make
your videos more visually interesting.</li>
